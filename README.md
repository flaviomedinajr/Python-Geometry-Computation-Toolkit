# Python-Geometry-Computation-Toolkit


- This project is a simple Python-based geometry calculator designed to compute areas and volumes of common 2D and 3D shapes. It helps users understand how geometry formulas can be applied using Python code through an interactive command line tool.

Lets users calculate the following:

✅ Area of a Circle

✅ Volume of a Sphere

✅ Area of a Rectangle

✅ Area of a Square

✅ Area of an Isosceles Triangle

✅ Area of an Equilateral Triangle

✅ Area of a Trapezoid

Each shape is calculated using standard math formulas. Users are prompted to input dimensions (like radius, height, width, etc.).
